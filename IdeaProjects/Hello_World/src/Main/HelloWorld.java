        is composed by several buttons and things for the user to do. There might be several boxes where the user inputs text, or simply fills out a scale.
        From this input, we then define a scanner to grab the users response and send a 'reply', meaning, if you do THIS, THAT happens. This is coding 101 in a nutshell.

        //Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Declaration:

        /*
        All programs require one or more classes that act as a model for the world.
        Classes are a blueprint for objects.
        For example, a program to track student test scores might have Student,
        Course, and Grade classes. Our real-world concerns, students and their grades,
        are inside the program as classes.

        The fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is the class.
        A class is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains.

        Java has pre-defined classes such as System (ex: System.out.println --> class = System, .out.println = actions )
       , which we’ve used in logging text to our screen, but we also need to write our own classes for the
       custom needs of a program.

       Definitions:
       - Public = access level modifier that allows other classes to interact with the class
       - Private = access level modifier, opposite to Public, where it restricts other classes to interact with the class

       Classes can also have multiple different constructors to prevent constructor-overloading, called a Signature.
       A signature is useful to differentiate different methods, which based on the arguments the user inputs, it
       uses the constructor that matches to the same data type sequence, for ex:

       public MyCar(String carColor, int year){
       }

       public MyCar(boolean electricCar, int year){
       }

       Note: It CANNOT have the same data type in the same order for each new constructor, or else the program won't be able
       to differentiate which one to respectfully choose.

       To call for the argument of your new object, simply do: ObjectName.ConstructorFieldName


         */

        //Jeep is an instance
        MyCar Jeep = new MyCar();
        //vW is an instance
        MyCar vW = new MyCar();

        System.out.println("My jeep is from " + Jeep.year);
        System.out.println("You can see here that I didn't add any brand name, using a default constructor, where the default value of the brand is = " + vW.brand);

        /*
        To allow users to input information about their object, we need to create our own
        constructor to assign the attributes (fields) that we made about our object
         */

        MyBrand Wahoo = new MyBrand("Wahoo", "Los Cabos", 2023, 300000);
        MyBrand Rabbix = new MyBrand("Rabbix.com", "South Korea", 2021, 2000000);
        System.out.println(Wahoo.yearR);
        System.out.println(Rabbix.cityName);


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        //Methods:

        /*
        In the last lesson, we learned that objects have state and behavior. We have seen how to give objects
        state through instance fields. Now, we’re going to learn how to create object behavior using methods.

        Methods are also reusable. Imagine we wrote a sandwich-making program that used 20 lines of code to
        make a single sandwich. Our program would become very long, very quickly, if we were making multiple
        sandwiches. By creating a makeSandwich() method, we can make a sandwich anytime simply by calling it.

        If we were to share this sandwich-making program with another person, they wouldn’t have to understand
        how makeSandwich() worked. If we wrote our program well, all they would need to know is that if they
        called makeSandwich(), they would receive a sandwich. This concept is known as procedural abstraction:
        knowing what a method does, but not how it accomplishes it.

        Concepts:
        - Void = there is no specific output from the method

        Everything that goes inside a method from the curly braces "{}" is called a scope.
        Any variable created inside the scope only exists inside the scope, it can't be called in the main() or
        used by other methods. To use a variable for multiple methods inside a class, it needs to be called
        in the instance fields.

        --> Parameters: Similar to how we added parameters to constructors, we can customize all other methods
        to accept parameters.

        Through method overloading, our Java programs can contain multiple methods with the same name as
        long as each method’s parameter list is unique, or its own "signature".

        MyStore lemonadeStand = new MyStore("Lemonade", 3.75);
        double lemonadePrice = lemonadeStand.getPriceWithTax();
        //instead of calling a long-butt name to call for the function, we can just simplify it by calling it with a variable
        //Basically we just save the process of a function without having to call it every time to remember what it did
        //THis can be useful whenever we have to use that variable within other functions
        //If we use the directory of that value it will get quite messy, still possible, just messy

            3. An increment or decrement statement.

        Normally, the for-Loop is structured like this:

         */

        increment our counter — something that is easy to forget when we increment with a while loop.

        //For-each-loop
        /*

        For-each loops, which are also referred to as enhanced loops, allow us to directly loop through each item in a list
        of items (like an array or ArrayList) and perform some action with each item.

        Its two characteristics:
        - It can iterate the index of an array or list
        - The loop control variable's parameter type is dependent on the array or list

        --> How to call it:
        for(Variable_type loop_control_name : (ARRAY_Name/LIST_Name){

        (parameters to iterate in every index)

        }

        Note: We can use ':' as saying "in", like this: "For each variable (i)  IN this array, do this"

        ***
        PRECAUTION !!! DO NOOOOOOOTTTT USE THIS TO DELETE INDEXES FROM LISTS. I did not hit her. Its not true, its bullshit! I did not hit her. I did NOOOOOT... oh hi Mark :D
        ***

        Removing elements during a for loop method for a LIST, we can easily run into an error if we aren’t careful.
        When an element is removed from an ArrayList, all the items that appear after the removed element will have their
        index value shift by negative one — it’s like all elements shifted to the left! We’ll have to be very careful with
        how we use our counter variable to avoid skipping elements.

        Basically to avoid this, we need to stay in the same index position in order to delete all indexes (or any specific ones), knowing that
        everything else will shift to the left, other values will still be left forgotten. Another method is going in the last index and going backwards.
        This ensures that nothing is skipped. However, all of this prohibits us from using the 'For-each-loop' because forcefully it increments the index.


        Using for-each-loop example:

         */

        List<Double> myPrices = new LinkedList<>();

        myPrices.add(122.5);
        myPrices.add(123.0);
        myPrices.add(100.1);
        myPrices.add(98.0);

        double mostExp = 0;

        for(double i : myPrices){
            if(i > mostExp){
                mostExp = i;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(mostExp);




        // 'Break' & 'Continue'
        // --> Break = The break keyword is used to exit, or break, a loop. Once break is executed, the loop will stop iterating. For example:


        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          System.out.println(i);
          if (i == 4) {
            break;
             }
        }

        // Note: it will only print till 4

        // --> Continue = The continue keyword can be placed inside of a loop if we want to skip an iteration. For example:

        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println(numbers[i]);
        }

        //return

        /*
        If the return keyword was executed inside a loop contained in a method, then the loop iteration would be
        stopped and the method/constructor would be exited.

        Whenever we make a return statement that can have certain conditionals,
        even if the loop is still viable to repeat itself, it will exit from the return statement.

        In other words, a return has like its own 'default' method

        For example:

        for (int i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(lst[i]);
            if (lst[i] == "jacket") {
              return true;
                }
              }
              return false;

       In this loop, suppose that it is within a boolean method, it will take the return statement immediately when
       one of them comes out, regardless if inside or outside a loop

        we have to predefine the memory storage it's going to take

        How to declare one:
        String myList[] = new String[n]

        Where "n" is the size of the array. DONT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE ARRAY'S INDEX ! This is only to determine its size. which will have n variables


        When we use new to create an empty array, each element of the array is initialized with a specific value depending on what type the element is:
        (Or better said, its default values when it's not assigned)
        int --> 0
        double --> 0.0
        boolean --> false
        String --> null;

        */

        double[] grades = new double[3];

        grades[0] = 9.8;
        grades[1] = 7.5;
        grades[2] = 6.0;

        System.out.println("The number of grades is " + grades.length);


        /*
        *Note:
        Square brackets [] are used only when your creating a new array, or referencing specifically within the index (Ex= menu[5])
        HOWEVER, whenever you play with the array, don't make the mistake of referencing its index, or an empty index without a purpose

        For example:

        - Wrong way:
            int a = myList[] + 3;

            Or:

            System.out.println(myList[].length);

        - Right way:
            int a = myList[2] + 3;

            Or:

            System.out.println(myList.length);

         */

        //Here you can play with Arrays by using instances of a class



        myNewsfeed sampleFeed = new myNewsfeed();

        System.out.println("The top topic is "+ sampleFeed.getTopTopic());

        /*
        In Java, arrays are considered Objects; therefore, we can also have an array of arrays.


        To declare it, we have two brackets: '[][]'
            This is called 'an array of arrays'

            Remember, because an array is an object, we are actually calling an object in another sense, like so:
            'VARIABLE_TYPE'[][]
            THIS is a type object.

         */

        /*

        int[][] List = new int[row][column];

        Remember:

        Rows are lines, or filas (horizontal)
        Columns are like vertical columns, or pillars like the 5 pilars of Islam (vertical)

         */

        int[][] list_a = new int[3][5];

        //Why are we asking for a 'new int' like an object ? Oh sorry, you forgot ... ITS A GOD DAM OBJECT !


        /*Additionally, we can have 2D arrays which are not rectangular in shape.
        These are called 'jagged' arrays:

        {1, 2}
        {4, 5, 6}
        {7, 8, 9, 10}

         */
        int[][] list2 = {{1, 2}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9, 10}};

        //Note: Arrays don't have to perfectly have the same size, because remember, ... arrays are also OBJECTS !!!

        //How to assign a new value, also known as 'Initializer list values'?

      String[][] mygrades;
      mygrades = new String[][]{{"Math", "A+"}, {"Dinamics", "A-"}};

      /* It's a mistake if we do String[2][2], because the size is already created by adding in the variables

      However, you CANT first initialize it with a fixed size, like:
       char[][] alp = new char[2][2];
       alp = {{'a', 'c'},{'d', 'e'}};

       You initialize it with a fixed size when you want to start out an empty 2D list
       Adding more to the note, to add values we simply doing it by calling its coordinate, like how we did it before.
       This brings us to the next topic...

       Locating the coordinates:
       The first way of thinking is that the first value represents a row and the second value represents a
       column in the matrix
       The second way of thinking is that the first value represents which subarray to access from the main array
       and the second value represents which element of the subarray is accessed

       * Size of an array:

       Note: It doesn't automatically gives us the total number, we need to calculate it by the number of arrays inside the list
       and the size of every array.

       For rows:
       int rowSize = list.length;

       For columns:
       int columnSize = list[index_of_array_you_want_to_calculate].length;

       */

        //For-Loops:

        /*

        We can organize ourselves by simply defining the "outer" and "inner" loop

            - Outer = Segment outside (how many times it is divided)
            - Inner = Segnemnt inside (how many variables inside each division)

        From these key points, we can determine how the sequence can iterate through our
        2D arrat for any case scenario.

        Lets see how this works:

        //Arrays with Objects

        /*
        Whenever we create multiple objects, it will create a clutter of them without having to track how many objects you've created.
        Maybe you only need to create only one or two objects at most from a class, but what if we had more than 20 cars being registered for a race ?
        We are going to have a class for Car to create every unique object, but it will come down to be a great disorder when we need to find them in our code.
        What do we do ? We create a list of those objects.

        How? Instead of adding primitive data types (int, String, boolean) to arrange our type of array, we can assign it its CLASS name

        Lets see the following example, using our class "MyRaceCar":

         */

        //We first create 3 objects

        MyRaceCar ferrari = new MyRaceCar("Ferrari", 1990);
        MyRaceCar nissan = new MyRaceCar("Nissan", 2003);
        MyRaceCar ford = new MyRaceCar("Ford", 1998);

        //Then we create an 'Object' list :

        //You can see here that instead of using the primitive type, it's the object type

        MyRaceCar[] raceFinalists = new MyRaceCar[3];

        raceFinalists[0] = ferrari;
        raceFinalists[1] = nissan;
        raceFinalists[2] = ford;


        //Lets create another list but all the participants of the race
        MyRaceCar vw = new MyRaceCar("VW", 2001);
        MyRaceCar Mercedes = new MyRaceCar("Mercedes", 1999);

        MyRaceCar[] totalRacers = new MyRaceCar[5];
        totalRacers[0] = ferrari;
        totalRacers[1] = nissan;
        totalRacers[2] = ford;
        totalRacers[3] = vw;
        totalRacers[4] = Mercedes;


        /*
        However, because its a normal Array, we cannot change the size of the list.
        Eventually we will see more on how an Array CAN change size
         */


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        //Lists

        /*
        List is an interface from java library that enables you to modify the storage capacity of an array,
        basically just acting as a list

        Difference with just normal arrays:
        - It is dynamic, not static, meaning that it can change size without only having a fixed size array
        - However, it depends on its use because the 'resize' operation in ArrayList slows down the performance.
        - Instead of having to create a for/loop method to create a new list, copy the last one and past it with the new list, the ArrayList
        already does it for you within its class from the Java library
        - Great benefit = You don't have to modify the toString method, you can DIRECTLY print out the actual list

        * The variable type has to be declared in its full name, in other words,
        it doesn't use primitive types (meaning int, double, char, etc... How we usually call them).
        These are called 'Wrapper Class':

        int --> Integer
        double --> Double
        char --> Character
        String (same)
        boolean --> "Boolean"

        ********************************************* IMPORTANT NOTE!!! ************************************************

        Lists are defined either:
        - Variable types
        - Object types
        - Null (collection of undefined elements, that could be either Variables or Objects)

        Later in the lesson we will see EACH of these cases, so don't worry, relax and enjoy the ride !

        ****************************************************************************************************************

        * How to declare it:
        List< 'Variable_Type' > Array_Name = new ArrayList< Variable_Type >();
            (or)
        List< 'Variable_Type' > Array_Name = new LinkedList< Variable_Type >();

       Note: in List<>, you can also name it ArrayList or LinkedList, it doesn't make a difference, like so:
        ArrayList< 'Variable_Type' > Array_Name = new ArrayList< Variable_Type >();


        * Within this interface, there are two types of concrete classes that make up Lists:
        --> ArrayList:
        - It's excellent at locating and retrieving values
        - But is worse at adding and removing values
        - PURPOSE: it's more for extensive lists that don't need much modifying in its capacity,
          but is much quicker on finding values

              => How it works:
              - When asked for a value, it immediately goes to the value's index
              - However, when adding or removing a new element - in other words, the storage capacity -
              it creates a new list

              CON: So everytime you add or subtract an element, it has to copy the previous one, make a new empty array
              with the modified storage capacity, and THEN paste the new modified array. Wasting a lot of time.


        --> LinkedList
        - It's excellent at adding and removing values
        - But it is worse at locating and retrieving values
        - PURPOSE: it's more focused on having to add or remove things from your list
          (especially faster if it's the beginning or the end)

              => How it works:
              - Every index is connected in between each other by reference points, or so called 'pointers'
              - These pointers can reference forwards or backwards
              - When asked for a value, it starts at the beginning and ending value, and if it needs to get
              in between the index, it has to follow these 'next' or 'previous' pointers to get the value it wants.

              CON: So if it needs to find the 400th element, it won't go directly there. It has to start at the first element
              and keep getting the next values until reaching the 400th element. THIS is why its not as efficient when dealing with long lists

              PRO: However, it doesn't create a new list. It only adds in to its capacity.


        --> BUT BEFORE WE START WITH LISTS...  Why '<>' ?? GENERICS!!

        Have you ever wondered if there could be a Class that can hold ANY kind of variable ?!? READ MORE !!!

        Generics: it gives you the ability to create a class that is flexible for any different type of variable
        Quick Example: You create a class just to print String values. What if you want it to have the SAME FUNCTIONALITY but for 'int' values ? Then we literally have to
        recreate that same class but replace the type 'String' to an 'int' type. What if we want it to hold a boolean value ??
        Basically, it makes repeated code that isn't efficient, causing it to be very extensive. That's why we need Generics, where we don't have to repeat our code and simply
        have a class that can take in any variable type and have the same functionality.

         */

        //Example of Generics:

        // In between the <> is where we call the type of variable we're going to use, or simply just telling our Class "Hey, I got this kind of food, we're cooking this tonight!"
        Generic_Printer<Integer> myPrinter = new Generic_Printer<>(2);

        Generic_Printer<String> myPrint2 = new Generic_Printer<>("Hewo");

        // You CAN do 'new Generic_Printer<String>("Hewo")', but it isn't necessary, its only OPTIONAL. It creates NO errors. Like the following example:

        Generic_Printer<Boolean> myPrint3 = new Generic_Printer<Boolean>(true);



        //Lists declaration:

        //You can see here that we don't need to specify the size of the list

        //Add element
                //With no specified index, by default, it is added in the very end of the list
        carShow.add("Volkswagen");
                //With specified index. Note: It moves all other elements to the right. HOWEVER, you CAN'T add it in an index that hasn't been created yet.
        carShow.add(0, "Jeep");

        //Set/replace an element
        carShow.set(3, "Nissan");

        //Remove element
        carShow.remove(4);
        carShow.remove("Porche");

        //Find element
        carShow.indexOf(1);

        //Clear Elements
        carShow.clear();

        //Print list = It automatically prints the actual list without you having to mess with the toString over-ride method

        --> Casting

        Casting in programming refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another.
        It's like telling the compiler to treat a variable as if it were of a different type.

        In the context of arrays and ArrayLists in Java, casting is often necessary when retrieving elements,
        especially if the data type of the elements is broader than what the variable can directly hold.

        Because you initialized your list only as a List, and in your constructors your currently trying to get an input as a
        "linked" list, then you have to make a CASTING to the program that can take a List (undefined) as a LinkedList

        If you already predefined it as a LinkList, you don't have to make this casting, because literally your giving
        the constructor a linked list, and it expects a linked list. So no need to cast.

        Another example of casting could be giving your program an integer when it expects a double.
        Because if it expects a double, you can convert the information of type double to type int by "casting it", like a magic spell

        You cast a spell where you convert variable types. BUT WARNING !! sometimes this can lose variable information

        Ex: Double x = 2.2

        System.out,println( (int)x  ) ;

        It will print out --> 2
        (Which looses information of the decimal point)


         */

        Because we already modified that our original list is a LinkedList, we don't need a cast, this is why they are shown in gray (we can just

        /*
       --> Access Modifiers:

            The public and private keywords and how they relate to Classes, variables, constructors, and methods

            * Void = has no return type

            * Static = a value or method that must be the same or be shared amongst your class. It is created so that no matter
                what object instance you create, it will share the same value. If you try to change that value from one object instance, it
                will change the same value for all other object instances.
                For example: All cats "meow". If we want to call for any Cat object of a method, they will all do the same thing. So we can
                leave it as static, because it will never change, independantly of how different every cat is like.

                BASICALLY: Static methods are methods that belong to an entire class, not a specific object of the class. Static methods are called
                using the class name and the "." operator.

                 PURPOSE = is to have a function without having the need of creating a new class object

                or example: random() is a static method that belongs to the Math class. We didn’t need to create a Math object
                (like Math myMathObject = new Math()) in order to use that method. We could just call it using the class name.
                There is no need to create an object because they'll all be the same within the method.
                So instead, we just refer to it in its blueprint (meaning the class)

                One important rule to note is that static methods can’t interact with non-static instance variables.

            * Public = any class has access

            * Private = When a Class’ instance variable or method is marked as private, that means that you can only
                access those structures from elsewhere inside that same class
                Concept: By limiting access by using the private keyword, we are able to segment, or encapsulate, our code into individual units.
                - What's the point?: It enables us to segment and organize our code, where we dont want classes to affect other classes.
                  In other words, not let the access of one class change anything by accident from another. It prevents having access to unecessary variables,
                  that at the same time, could be at risk of being changed without prior acknowledgement

                  Note: "private" variables can be used within the same class if its called within the class.
                  Same goes for methods if its called INSIDE the method.
                  HOWEVER, it cannot be USED OUTSIDE THE AREA SPACE where it was claimed.

            * Final = means that you can’t change the variable’s value after creating it. Any class cannot be extended or overrided if used Final

            * Protected = it gives access to all the classes that it is contained within a package



        --> The concept of encapsulation:

            Encapsulation is a technique used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes.
            Its aim is to create small bundles of logic.

            Think of it as a house and a key.

            If you have different locks inside the  house, you can only unlock them being in the house.
            In other words, having a class with private variables can only be accessed by the class, or so called, its capsule.

            Another way of understanding it is a hierarchy, like so (in terms of being 'inside of'):

                    * Packages <HAS ACCESS TO> == (Private Classes) (Public Classes)
                    --> Classes have access to others by being in the SAME package

                    * Classes   <HAS ACCESS TO> == (Private Methods & Variables) (Public Methods & Variables)
                    --> Methods and variables can use other methods and variables of the SAME class

                    * Methods  <HAS ACCESS TO> == (Other Private Methods & Variables) (Other Public Methods & Variables)


            HOWEVER: We can't have access two paths down the line. Meaning that i cant have direct access to a
            private variable of a class. But there is a way ...


            * Accessor methods, sometimes known as “getters”:

            You make a variable that is private, and for other classes to have access to it, you create a method
            instead of accidentally calling them, which is prevented from being private, we can call them from methods.
            Just like the java library !!!


            * Mutator methods, sometimes known as “setters”:
            You make a variable that is private, and for other classes to CHANGE IT, you create a method to have access to it

        --> Scope:
            Local variables vs. instance variables

            * Local variables = variables that are defined within a parameter cannot be called outside of it, in onther words,
            outside its 'scope'. Such as a method, local variables inside of it cannot be called out.

           Note: Can I call a local variable public and then use it ? What if i call it private ?

            If you try to declare a local variable with an access modifier like public or private
            within a method in Java, you'll get a compilation error. Local variables cannot have access modifiers in Java.
            They are inherently limited to the scope in which they are declared.

        Is it possible to have methods inside other methods?
        No, in most programming languages, including Java, you cannot directly nest methods within other methods.
        Methods are typically declared at the class level, not within the scope of another method.
        However, you can call one method from another method, creating a form of method hierarchy or composition.

        /*
        --> The 'this' keyword
            The 'this' keyword calls the instance of the object

            - For variables:
            Because there will be many cases that we'll be using the same name for both instance and local variables,
            our program can accidentally print out the unintended variable because by default it has preference to its local variable.
            If you want to refer to the instance variable, you do:

            this.VAR_NAME //Instance name

            VAR_NAME //Local name

            - For methods:
            We can  call for different methods inside a method by using 'this'. Instead of having to create a new method
            with the same functionality as others, we can just call existing methods of the objects instance.

            Ex:

            public void setBrightness(int inputBrightness){
                this.brightness = inputBrightness;
            }

            public void setVolume(int inputVolume){

          }


            - For objects:
            The "this" keyword is literally referencing the instance object, so for any method that has an input for an object, we can use the "this" keyword

        /*
        Inheritance is basically gaining all the methods and instances of the parent class, king class, super class ... however you may call it.

        It works by using the keyword "extends" when creating a subclass from the parent class

        We create an “is-a” relationship from the subclass to the superclass.

            A car "is a" vehicle
            A bicycle "is a" vehicle

            (assuming that we have class car, bicycle and vehicle)

            public class bicycle extends vehicle { ... } (Child class)

        * Run-time Errors = Errors which happen during program execution (run-time) after successful
        compilation are called run-time errors. Run-time errors occur when a program with no compile-time errors
        asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do.

            - Exceptions = Java uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional events.
            Exceptions are the conditions that occur at runtime and may cause the termination of the program.
            W
            hen an exception occurs, Java displays a message that includes the name of the exception,
            the line of the program where the exception occurred, and a stack trace. The stack trace includes:
                The method that was running

                - NullPointerException: You tried to access an instance variable or invoke a method on an object that is currently null.
                - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: The index you are using is either negative or greater than the last index of the array (i.e., array.length-1).
                - FileNotFoundException: Java didn’t find the file it was looking for.

          *Logic errors = its a design flaw in your program. It preforms perfectly fine but outputs something that isn't expected.


          IMPORTANT NOTE/STRATEGY: one way to fix a bug, you can use the keyboard shortcut 'command' + '/' to comment it out
          What you do is you comment out half your code, and if the error stops, you know that the error is originating from the code you just commented.
          If not, you keed commenting half your code until it stops.
